## CRYPTFUND

#### hackVSIT

We are developing a platform using Ethereum and Solidity to imporve and optimize the money transaction mechanism of any public funded organisation/NGO.

Features:-

1.All the contributed money is inside the smart contract instead of private bank and money can only be accessed by using specific functionalities that are encoded inside the smart contract.

2.Generates smart contracts for the use of fund, which requires approval of the contributions 
 
by the means of voting (i.e., approval by majority).
 
3. Impenetrable contract provides high security.
 
4.Provides transparency for all money transactions.
