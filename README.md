# CRYPT-FUND
We are developing a platform using Ethereum and Solidity to improve and optimize the money transaction mechanism of any public funded organisation/NGO.

Features:-

* All the contributed money is inside the smart contract instead of private bank and money can only be accessed by using specific functionalities that are encoded inside the smart contract.

* Generates smart contracts for the use of fund, which requires approval of the contributions 
 
by the means of voting (i.e., approval by majority).
 
* Impenetrable contract provides high security.
 
* Provides transparency for all money transactions.

# Tech Stack used

* Next.js(Reactjs Framework)
* Semantic-ui
* Ethereum
* Solidity
* Web3.js
